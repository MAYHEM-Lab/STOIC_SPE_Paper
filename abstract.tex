Serverless computing is an emerging event-driven programming model that accelerates the development and deployment of scalable web services on cloud computing systems. Though widely integrated with public cloud, serverless computing is not systemically investigated in edge cloud and IoT settings.

In this work, we present STOIC (Serverless TeleOperable HybrId Cloud), an IoT application deployment and offloading system that extends the serverless model in three ways. First, STOIC adopts a dynamic feedback control mechanism to precisely predict latency and dispatch workloads uniformly across edge and cloud systems using a single serverless framework. Second, STOIC leverages hardware acceleration (e.g. GPU resources) in serverless function execution when available from the underlying cloud system. Third, STOIC provides selector and duplicator modes to address the deployment variability associated with using public clouds. We overview the design and implementation of STOIC and empirically evaluate it using real-world machine learning applications and multi-tier IoT deployments (edge and cloud). Specifically, we show that STOIC can be used for image processing workloads (object recognition) -- once thought too resource-intensive for edge deployments. We find that STOIC reduces overall execution time (response latency) and achieves placement accuracy that ranges from 92\% to 97\%.
